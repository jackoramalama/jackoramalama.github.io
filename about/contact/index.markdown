### Freenode IRC

Join us for live chat on [Freenode IRC](http://freenode.net/), all members are present in the #freexperia channel, though they might not always be at the computer. If you ask a question but don't get an immediate response just stick around, someone will eventually reply.

### Google+ Community

We have a dedicated [Google+ community](https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/104168762781398056885) where FXP users help each other. Be sure to drop by and say hi!

### XDA Developers

Each device has its own FXP release thread on [XDA Developers](http://www.xda-developers.com/), the largest online Android community. Most likely your question has already been asked and answered there!
